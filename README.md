First, we processed the dataset and stored it in a directory named "Data", which contains training, validation, and testing files for the Movielens 1M and Bookcrossing datasets. Additionally, ML_run.py serves as the execution file for the Movielens 1M dataset, while BOOK_run.py serves as the execution file for the Bookcrossing dataset. Simply run these two files to start model training seamlessly.
